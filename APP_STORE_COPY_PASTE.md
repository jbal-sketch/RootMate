## Description

```
RootMate gives your houseplants a personality. Each plant has its own voice—from Drama Queens using Gen-Z slang to Grumpy Seniors with dry wit. Get daily personalized, weather-aware, and hilarious messages from your plant rootmates. It's the Tamagotchi for real plants.

KEY FEATURES:

💬 Daily Plant Chat
Get personalized messages from your plants every day. Each message reflects your plant's unique personality, current status, and even the weather.

🌦️ Weather-Aware Updates
Your plants know when it's raining! They'll comment on the weather and adjust their messages accordingly.

📊 Health Tracking
Track your plant's health streak and status. See at a glance which plants are hydrated, thirsty, or need urgent care.

🔔 Smart Notifications
Get daily reminders from your plants at a time that works for you. Each notification is personalized to your plant's personality.

🌱 Plant Profiles
Each plant has its own profile with nickname, species, personality type, and care history. Get to know your rootmates!

💧 Watering Tracker
Log when you water your plants. Your plants remember and will reference your care in their daily messages.

🏷️ QR Code Stickers (Coming Soon)
Print branded QR code stickers for your plant pots. Perfect for plant sitters and house guests.

PERSONALITY TYPES:
• Drama Queen 💅 - Gen-Z slang, melodramatic, attention-seeking
• Chill Roomie 😎 - Laid back, supportive, easy-going
• Grumpy Senior 🤨 - Dry wit, disciplined, old-school
• Sunshine Buddy ☀️ - Energetic, positive, enthusiastic
• Zen Master 🧘 - Calm, wise, meditative

Why Personality Matters:
Most plant apps treat your green friends like data points. RootMate treats them like roommates with personalities. When your Fiddle Leaf Fig is a Drama Queen who uses Gen-Z slang, or your Snake Plant is a Grumpy Senior with dry wit, you don't just care for them—you care about them.

Perfect for both beginners and experienced plant parents who want plant care to be fun, engaging, and memorable.

Your plants called. They're thirsty. And they have opinions about it.
